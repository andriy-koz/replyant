There's a common misconception I run into constantly: people hear "AI agent" and think "chatbot." The two could not be more different.

## Chatbots React. Agents Act.

A chatbot sits in a widget on your website and waits for someone to ask it a question. It retrieves an answer — maybe from a knowledge base, maybe from an LLM — and hands it back. Conversation over.

An AI agent operates on a fundamentally different level. It:

- **Plans** — Given a goal, it breaks down the steps required to achieve it.
- **Uses tools** — It can call APIs, query databases, read documents, write files, and trigger workflows.
- **Makes decisions** — It evaluates intermediate results and adjusts its approach.
- **Completes tasks** — It doesn't just inform. It executes.

## Why This Matters for Your Business

When you deploy a chatbot, you get a slightly better FAQ page. When you deploy an AI agent, you get a digital worker that can handle multi-step processes end to end.

Think about the difference:

- A chatbot tells a customer their order status. An agent processes a return, updates inventory, triggers a refund, and sends a confirmation email.
- A chatbot suggests blog topics. An agent researches keywords, drafts content, formats it, and schedules publication.
- A chatbot answers HR questions. An agent onboards a new employee — creating accounts, assigning training, and scheduling introductions.

## The Architecture Shift

Building agents requires a different mindset than building chatbots. You need to think about:

- **Tool design** — What capabilities does the agent need access to?
- **Memory and context** — How does the agent track state across a multi-step workflow?
- **Guardrails** — Where do you need human-in-the-loop checkpoints?
- **Reliability** — How do you handle failures, retries, and edge cases?

These are engineering problems, not prompt engineering problems. And solving them well is where the real competitive advantage lives.

## Start With One Workflow

If you're new to agents, don't try to automate everything at once. Pick one repetitive, multi-step workflow in your business. Map it out. Then ask: could an agent handle this?

The answer is almost always yes. The question is how well — and that's where the engineering work begins.

More on that tomorrow.
